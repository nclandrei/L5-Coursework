                  and values are highl correlated cross-sectionally,
                  and that deviations between them are small Yet after
                  controlling for variations in industry size that
                  produce spuriou correlation', I find no reliable
                  evidence that relative values have an influence upon
                  relative prices. The smallness of price-value
                  deviation thus does not result from such an
                  influence; it is shown instead to resul from a lack
                  of dispersion in the data. Values turn out to be no
                  bette predictors of prices than any other random
                  variable with the same probabilit distribution.},
